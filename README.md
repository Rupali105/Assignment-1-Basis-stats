Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child 
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.
Child B – probability of having 4 candies = 0.20
Ans
 
= 1 * 0.015 + 4*0.20 + 3 *0.65 + 5*0.005 + 6 *0.01 + 2 * 0.12 = 0.015 + 0.8 + 1.95 + 0.025 + 0.06 + 0.24 = 3.090

Q11)  Suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult male in    Mexico. We draw a random sample of 2,000 men from a population of 3,000,000 men and weigh them. We find that the average person in our sample weighs 200 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds. Calculate 94%,98%,96% confidence interval?
Ans : Refer Q11 python file
Q12)  Below are the scores obtained by a student in tests 
34,36,36,38,38,39,39,40,40,41,41,41,41,42,42,45,49,56
1)	Find mean, median, variance, standard deviation.
2)	What can we say about the student marks? 
Ans : Refer python file Q12
Q13) What is the nature of skewness when mean, median of data are equal?
Ans :If Mean , median and mode are equal the skewness is zero. 
And distribution is symmetric
Q14) What is the nature of skewness when mean > median ?
Ans :If the mean is greater than the median, the distribution is positively skewed.
Q15) What is the nature of skewness when median > mean?
Ans:When the median is greater than the mean, the distribution is left /negativeskewed
Q16) What does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data ?
Ans
1. Heavy Tails: Positive kurtosis indicates that the tails of the distribution are fatter or heavier than those of a normal distribution. This means there is an increased probability of extreme values (outliers) in the dataset.
2. Leptokurtic Distribution: A distribution with positive kurtosis is often referred to as leptokurtic. It has a sharper peak and heavier tails compared to a normal distribution.
3. Outliers: The presence of positive kurtosis suggests that there may be more outliers or extreme values in the dataset. Extreme values can contribute to increased volatility and variability in the data.
4. Tailedness: Positive kurtosis is associated with a distribution that has more data points in the tails than a normal distribution. This can affect statistical analyses that assume a normal distribution.

Q17) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?
ANS
Key points about negative kurtosis:
1. Lighter Tails: Negative kurtosis indicates that the tails of the distribution are less heavy or fatter than those of a normal distribution. This suggests a lower probability of extreme values (outliers) in the dataset.
2. Platykurtic Distribution: A distribution with negative kurtosis is often referred to as platykurtic. It has a flatter peak and lighter tails compared to a normal distribution.
3. Less Outliers: The presence of negative kurtosis suggests that there may be fewer outliers or extreme values in the dataset. The distribution has less variability in the tails.
4. Distribution Spread: Negative kurtosis is associated with a distribution that has less data in the tails than a normal distribution. This can result in a more spread-out or dispersed distribution.
